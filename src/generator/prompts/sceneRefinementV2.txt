OUTPUT CONTRACT
- Format: JSON (same schema as original plan)
- Output the COMPLETE revised plan, not just changes

TASK: Revise the scene plan to address evaluation feedback.

You will receive:
1. The original scene plan (schemaVersion 2)
2. Evaluation feedback with issues to fix

REFINEMENT RULES

For each issue type, apply these fixes:

CLUSTERING
- Identify which structures are too close
- Spread them apart: maintain 50-100m between structures
- Keep focal structure near center, move others toward edges/corners

EMPTY_REGION
- Add a structure or move existing one to fill the gap
- Background elements go toward north (z: 50-150)
- Side elements go toward east/west edges (x: 50-100 or 300-350)

FACING
- Change the structure's "facing" to "south" (toward camera)
- Exception: background framing elements can face inward

MISSING
- Add the missing element as a new structure or attachment
- Position appropriately based on its role (focal, background, decoration)

SCALE
- Adjust realWorldSize up or down
- Typical sizes: humans 1.8m, houses 10-15m, large trees 15-25m

OVERLAP
- Move one structure away from the other
- Maintain minimum 25m between structure centers

CONSTRAINTS (must still satisfy)
- All positions within [20, 380]
- Minimum 25m between structures
- Main focal structure faces south
- Valid structure ID references in attachments
