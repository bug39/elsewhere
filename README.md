**AI-Powered 3D World Studio**

Describe what you want and AI builds it — 3D assets, entire scenes, living worlds you can explore in third person. Built for the Gemini API Developer Competition.

## What You Can Do

- **Generate assets** from text prompts — "a cozy cabin with smoke from the chimney"
- **Generate entire scenes** — "a medieval village marketplace" plans, creates, and places everything
- **Arrange worlds** on a 400m terrain with biomes, heightmaps, and textures
- **Script NPCs** with behaviors and branching dialogue trees
- **Play** your world in third person — walk, run, jump, talk to NPCs

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000
```
