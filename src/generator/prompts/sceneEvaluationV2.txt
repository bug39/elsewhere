OUTPUT CONTRACT

- No markdown, no commentary

TASK: Evaluate the scene screenshot for composition quality.

You will receive:
1. A screenshot of the rendered scene
2. The original user prompt
3. The scene plan with structure IDs and positions

EVALUATION CRITERIA
Focus on GESTALT perception — does the scene feel intentionally composed?

Issue types to detect:
- clustering: Multiple structures bunched in one area
- empty_region: Large area with nothing (quadrant or half empty)
- facing: Structure shows wrong side to camera (back instead of front)
- missing: Expected element from prompt not visible
- scale: Asset appears wrong size relative to others
- overlap: Assets clipping through each other

COORDINATE REFERENCE
- World is 400m x 400m
- Center is (200, 200)
- Camera is at SOUTH edge, looking NORTH
- Quadrants: NW (0-200, 0-200), NE (200-400, 0-200), SW (0-200, 200-400), SE (200-400, 200-400)

  "overallImpression": "one sentence summary",
  "issues": [
    {

    }
  ]
}

VERDICT GUIDELINES
- "accept": Scene looks intentionally composed, no major issues
- "needs_work": One or more significant composition problems

IMPORTANT
- Reference structures by their ID from the plan (e.g., "diner", "barn")
- Describe issues semantically ("spread structures apart", "rotate to face camera")
- Do NOT suggest specific coordinates — the refinement step handles that
- 0-2 issues is normal for a good scene
- 3+ issues suggests "needs_work"

OUTPUT ONLY VALID JSON.
